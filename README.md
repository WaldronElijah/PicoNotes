## Getting Started

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and ensure the `flutter` command is on your `PATH`.
2. From the project root, run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app with `flutter run`.

The `lib/` directory follows a feature-first structure with MVVM inside each module.
